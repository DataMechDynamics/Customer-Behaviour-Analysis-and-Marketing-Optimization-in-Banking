Customer Behavior Analysis and Marketing Optimization in Banking

Overview

This project leverages both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze customer behavior and optimize marketing strategies in the banking sector. It focuses on:
Classification: Predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.
Clustering: Discovering hidden patterns and grouping customers with similar characteristics.

Goals

Supervised Learning: Develop accurate models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to identify potential customers for term deposit subscriptions.
Unsupervised Learning: Use clustering methods (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN) to segment customers for personalized campaigns.
Emphasize data preprocessing to address missing values, outliers, and class imbalances for robust analysis.
